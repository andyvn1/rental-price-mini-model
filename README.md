# rental-price-mini-model
Rental Price Mini-Model is a compact, reproducible project that predicts monthly rent (USD) from basic listing features (beds, baths, sqft, city, property type, amenities). It builds a transparent linear-regression baseline (OLS/Ridge/Lasso), reports RMSE/MAE/RÂ² on a held-out test split, and saves the best model and metrics for quick iteration.
